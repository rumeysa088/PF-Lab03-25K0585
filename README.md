## About Me
I'm a curious and driven programmer with a love for solving puzzles and creating things that actually work. I enjoy experimenting with code, breaking things (on purpose), and learning from the chaos. Whether it's building sleek user interfaces or diving into the logic behind algorithms, I like to keep my brain busy.

**Programming Interests**

* Game Development: I love crafting small, weird games — especially those with retro vibes or experimental mechanics. Unity and Godot are my playgrounds.

* AI & Machine Learning: Training models, playing with generative AI, and wondering if Skynet is already watching.

* Web Development: Building web apps that are fast, functional, and just a little too stylish.

* Automation: If I can write a script to do it, I probably already have. (Even if it would’ve been faster to do it manually.)

* Languages: JavaScript (the chaotic good), Python (the chill one), and Rust (the one I fight with but secretly admire).
